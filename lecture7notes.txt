Lecture 7- Classes and Objects

-Defines functions to exist associated with a specific object
    -effectively is a generator for a set of specific objects
-can inheret things across classes

-Everything in Python is an object

-Example: define integer a=1
    -Int() is a class, and we have defined an single instance, or an object, "a" in the class "Int()"
    -"a" has various attributes, which are variables associated with an object
        -ex: a.real is an attribute of "a"
        -ex: a.__abs__ gives absolute value of "a" and is a method of class "int()"
